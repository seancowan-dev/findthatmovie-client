This application allows users to search for movie trailers and to leave comments about the movies they have watched.  In addition they can create lists to store movies they have watched, or want to watch.  This is enabled with one-click adding on the individual pages for each movie.  It uses the TMDB.org API as the source for the movie data, and YouTube as the source of the trailers. 

I developed this at Thinkful as version 2 of my earlier app of the same name: https://github.com/seancowan-dev/findthatmovie

The purpose of rebuilding this app in React is to show my ability to use a variety of technologies, and my ability to learn React in a short time frame (6 months).  The feature set of this app has been adjusted so that users can actually leave comments themselves.  The addition of the list feature, and the removal of text reviews from TMDB.org create a more streamlined user experience.

## Why This App Was Made

We've all gone through the same process when trying to find a new movie to either go see at a theatre, or stream at home.  You know the one; where you go to IMDB or some similar site, looks for new titles, then you go to youtube and watch some trailers, then you try to find reviews of the movie on Reddit.  Finally after all that you decide that particular movie isn't for you and you go back to the list and start the whole process over again.

To solve that I made Findthatmovie.  Now you can keep a list of movies you've watched, or want to watch, and find trailers all in one place.  Future versions will also provide links directly to 3rd party streaming services to further expedite the time it takes from wanting to watch to actually watching.
